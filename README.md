**1. Project Overview
  The "Nail Salon Appointment Booking System" is a full-stack web application built using Spring Boot (Java) for the backend and Thymeleaf for the frontend. The system allows users to register, log in, view salon services, book appointments, make payments, and allows admins to manage services and payments.

**2. Team Members and Roles
  •	Yuchen Wei: User Authentication (Register/Login)
  •	Dariya Takenova: Service Management (CRUD on Salon Services)
  •	Rafiat Bolaji: Appointment Management (Booking & Viewing Appointments)
  •	Ahmed Mir Mohiuddin: Payment Processing (Handling Payments & Status Updates)

**3. Technologies Used
  •	Backend: Spring Boot 3.4.3, Spring Security, Spring Data JPA
  •	Frontend: Thymeleaf, Bootstrap 5
  •	Database: MySQL
  •	API Documentation: Swagger (Springdoc OpenAPI)
  •	Build Tool: Maven
  •	Environment Management: Profiles for dev and prod

**4. System Features
  **4.1 User Authentication (Yuchen Wei)
  •	Implemented secure registration and login using Spring Security
  •	Passwords are encrypted with BCryptPasswordEncoder
  •	Users are redirected based on roles (USER/ADMIN)
  •	Custom UserDetailsService and AuthenticationSuccessHandler used for role-based routing
  •	Thymeleaf templates: register.html, login.html
  **4.2 Service Management (Dariya Takenova)
  •	Admins can add, edit, delete, and view services
  •	Entity: OfferedServices with fields: name, duration, price, description
  •	Full CRUD handled through ServiceController, ServiceService, ServiceRepository
  •	Templates: services.html, service-form.html
  **4.3 Appointment Management (Rafiat Bolaji)
  •	Authenticated users can view and book appointments
  •	Entity: Appointment with fields: customerName, email, service, price, dateTime, status
  •	Booking auto-fills price based on selected service
  •	Templates: appointments.html, appointment-form.html
  •	Appointment history section and deletion included
  **4.4 Payment Processing (Ahmed Mir Mohiuddin)
  •	Each appointment has one or more associated Payment records
  •	Admin and users can view payment details
  •	Admins can update payment statuses (PAID/FAILED)
  •	Transaction ID is autogenerated using UUID
  •	Templates: payment.html, payment-status.html

**5. Architecture Summary
•	Modular service layer (UserService, AppointmentService, PaymentService, etc.)
•	Use of enums (UserRoles, PaymentStatus) for clarity and safety
•	Clean separation of concerns between controller, service, and repository layers
•	Thymeleaf templates structured by module (e.g., auth, appointments, services)

**6. Testing & Deployment
•	All modules tested with Postman and browser
•	Spring profiles (dev / prod) used for switching DB environments
•	Manual verification of security, data integrity, and role access
•	Code committed and maintained on GitHub with full documentation

**7. Challenges Faced
•	Managing multiple user roles (ADMIN, USER) with Spring Security
•	Syncing payment status and appointment status accurately
•	Rendering conditional templates (e.g., hide buttons based on status or role)

**8. Outcome and Learnings
•	Fully functional application deployed and demonstrated successfully
•	Strong understanding of Spring Boot security and MVC design patterns
•	Hands-on experience with end-to-end full stack development and team collaboration

**9. Future Improvements
•	Integrate payment gateway (Stripe/PayPal)
•	Enable email notifications for booking/payment confirmations
•	Add service categories and search filter
•	Improve error handling and exception tracing

**10. Conclusion 
The Nail Salon Appointment Booking System project provided valuable experience in full stack development, secure authentication, team collaboration, and feature integration. Each module was completed as per the planned task distribution, resulting in a coherent and production-ready system.
